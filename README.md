## MP3 Tag Reader and Editor 🎵

A Command-Line Interface (CLI) project developed in C for reading and editing ID3 tags (metadata) of MP3 files.  
Created during my **Embedded Systems Internship at Emertxe Information Technologies, Bangalore**.

## 📔 Features
- Extracts metadata such as Title, Artist, Album, and Year  
- Supports ID3v1 tag validation  
- Securely reads and parses MP3 tag fields  
- Handles missing or malformed tags gracefully  
- Modular design with separate file handling and tag parsing functions  

## 🛠 Technologies & Concepts Used
- C Programming (Pointers, Arrays, Structures)
- Binary File I/O (fopen, fread, fseek, fclose)
- ID3 Tag Standards (ID3v1 & ID3v2)
- Defensive Programming & Input Validation
- Console-Based Application Design

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
Enhanced understanding of binary data manipulation, metadata parsing, and secure file operations.

## 📂 Project Files
- `main.c` – Entry point  
- `mp3header.h` – Header definitions  
- `mp3tag_reader.c` – Core logic for reading tags  
- `Makefile` (optional) – For compiling the project
